                        My name is Andrew Bubar. I was born and raised in the state of Maine and currently 
                        attend the Word of Life Bible Institute. I am a follower of God, and was raised in a 
                        Christian home by my two loving parents. As such I accepted the Holy Spirit into my 
                        heart at the age of two. Though I wouldn’t understand what it meant till much later. 
                        Around the age of twelve my relationship with God became serious, as my family went 
                        though a divorce and I wished to understand why. By reading Romans from start to 
                        finish, I was able to truly understand what it meant to be saved and the gift I had 
                        received all those years ago. With this understanding I made the choice to be 
                        baptized. It was not long after that I found my passion for programming and 
                        technology in general. I only recently graduated High-School. During my High-School 
                        Eduction, I attended a CTE (Career Tech Education) school where I learned how 
                        to develop various types of software with a focus on Game Development with several 
                        different types of languages. After two years of going to normal High School 
                        and the CTE for half and half of every school day, I graduated. Shortly 
                        there after, I went down to Hudson Flordia to work at the summer camp as 
                        a supervisor before my education at the Word of Life Bible Institute.

                            though I have no qualms against designing the web-site myself. 
                            When it comes to web development, 
                            I can make anything from a simple blog site that you can easily post to yourself, 
                            and many different types of Web Applications, like a document creator/editor, 
                            creating a private storage hub for all your files, 
                            or even working with neural networks.

                            While I was into Game Development, 
                            I would looking for a competition for a good reason and motivation to have a project. 
                            Sadly there aren’t many Game development competitions in Maine. 
                            So when I heard of the Arrive Alive competition, 
                            I knew I should at least try. 
                            It looked like fun to spend only a month on a single project, 
                            and to have it completely done. 
                            Everything (except for the music and sound effects) was created and developed by me. 
                            For my efforts I received third place out of hundreds of various types of submissions.

                        I have become very fond of this programing language 
                        as it is the preferred language used for the engine. 
                        I have made other types of projects with the language. 
                        An example would be when I made a voice assistant 
                        to help me open my applications for my classes faster.

                    <h1>Java</h1>
                    <p>
                        This language is one of my favorites, 
                        but I don’t normally use it, 
                        as I enjoy working with a pre-established 
                        frame work when making computer applications. 
                        That’s not to say I haven’t worked with the language, 
                        I have created a very simple game engine to learn what it took. 
                        I will just commonly use either C# or JavaScript.

                <div class="portfilio-description">
                    <h1>Python 3</h1>
                    <p>
                        This is the language that I will admit 
                        I have the least experience with here listed. 
                        I listed it because I still understand fundamentals 
                        and the core extensions. 
                        As well as I am willing to learn more 
                        about the language if you would prefer me to work with it.

                    <p>
                        My self education of these languages is recent, 
                        but I have tried to learn the fundamentals, 
                        and I feel this site speaks for what I have learned so far.
